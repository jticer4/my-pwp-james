		<h1>My Pwp James</h1>
		<h3>Purpose:</h3>
			<p>I want my PWP to serve as a portfolio I can use to market myself to employers after boot camp is finished.</p>
		<h3>Audience:</h3>
			<p>The audience for my site will be Technical Leads from potential employers. I'm interested in attracting attention
				from small start-ups.</p>
		<h3>Goal:</h3>
			<p>To demonstrate my technical expertise to Technical Leads and Internal Recruiters, with the goal of getting hired as a Web Developer. </p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
			<h4>Name:</h4>

			<h4>Technology:</h4>
				<p>iPhone 7 running iOS 11 and an HP Envy running the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
			<h4>Attitudes:</h4>
				<p>Pamela is a Technical Lead at a Scoutible. She only wants to interview people who have a well rounded
				understanding of the role played by a Web Developer. She really appreciates it when people ask the right questions.
				She wants the person she hires to be personable because she feels like life is too short to work with people you
				don't like.</p>
			<h4>Behaviors:</h4>
				<p>Pamela has been reading resumes all day and is starting to become frustrated. She has gotten so impatient
				that she is now rushing through applicants waiting for someone to stand out from the crowd. She tends to notice
				people who carry a positive attitude and clearly demonstrate that they enjoy their work. She tends to remember the
				people who follow up after the interview.</p>
			<h4>Goal:</h4>
				<p>Pamela wants to hire somebody who knows what they're doing and is excited to work at Scoutible. She wants to feel confident that she has made the right decision.
				Her goal is to find someone who can hit the ground running, and is able to contribute right away.</p>
