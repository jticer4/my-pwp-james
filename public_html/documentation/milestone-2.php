		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p><strong>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</strong></p>
		<h3>Overall</h3>
		<p>I want to include my favorite quotes(or quotes about me) below each of the main headings.(these quotes will
			serve to address common concerns that technical leads or recruiters may have)</p>
		<h3>Welcome</h3>
		<p>A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Software Developer. This welcome
			message will be overlaid on a large background image of the island I grew up on, Kauai.
			Additionally, I will include sticky links to my Git, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Email, in the top right corner.
			I will also include a drop down menu in the top left corner that will allow users to quickly navigate to the
			main sections of my site. This drop down menu will stay fixed in the top left corner as the user scrolls
			through the page. Lastly, there will be a tiny arrow at the very bottom, prompting the user to scroll down.
		</p>
		<h3>Profile</h3>
		<p>This section will consist of an "about me" & "details" section. The about me section will provide a quick high
			level overview of my most notable accomplishments, and will be written in my own "voice". The details section
			will provide some basic information about me, such as, my name, age, location, and a button to follow me on
			twitter. This section will also include an image of my professional headshot.
		</p>
		<h3>Experience</h3>
		<p>This section will consist of my education, experience, and projects. I will first briefly summarize my
			educational and training history. Then I will provide an overall look at my experience and projects, with the
			goal being to showcase the quality of my work. Each achievement will include a quick summary below a small
			screenshot of what is being summarized.
		</p>
		<h3>Abilities and Tools</h3>
		<p>This section will highlight my technical expertise and will offer more information as to how familiar I am with
			each Language or Tool. This information will be displayed as a one to five star rating.
		</p>
		<h3>Contact</h3>
		<p>This will be my last section and will include a set of links to my Git hub, LinkedIn, Twitter, and email. When
			the user clicks on the email logo it will automatically open their default email application and auto populate
			my email address into the "to" section of the email.
