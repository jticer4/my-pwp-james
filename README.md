### Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work on outlining the direction for your portfolio site. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful and well defined. Nice work.

A few key words and phrases stood out to me:
- "_...well rounded understanding of the role played by a Web Developer..._"
- "_...appreciates it when people ask the right questions..._"
- "_personable_"
- "_...waiting for someone to stand out from the crowd..._"
- "_excited_" and "_...able to contribute right away..._"
- ...and all of Pamela's frustrations

This is really great stuff here - I'm looking forward to seeing how you address the points above in your content strategy and UI design phase ahead. Your project is all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice job.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.
