This is my personal website project. 

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work on outlining the direction for your portfolio site. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful and well defined. Nice work.

A few key words and phrases stood out to me:
- "_...well rounded understanding of the role played by a Web Developer..._"
- "_...appreciates it when people ask the right questions..._"
- "_personable_"
- "_...waiting for someone to stand out from the crowd..._"
- "_excited_" and "_...able to contribute right away..._"
- ...and all of Pamela's frustrations

This is really great stuff here - I'm looking forward to seeing how you address the points above in your content strategy and UI design phase ahead. Your project is all set up to spec and your code looks good - nice job.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Be sure to add `/vendor` to your .gitignore
- Keep an eye on yout HTML indentation - you shouldn't indent the tags falling after your `<h4>` headings - these are not children of the `<h4>` elements.

### Milestone 2a Feedback
Beautiful work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy. This will provide you with a great guide for your development phase ahead. Nice work.

I don't see a contact form in your wireframes. The contact form is a project requirement - so please plan on building one. You can still include the email link, although you may be exposing yourself to spam. Here's some info on `mailto` links: https://goo.gl/qow9JG

Overall your layout ideas should work very well with the Bootstrap framework. The default Bootstrap navbar should work for you, and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) should work well for your icons. For your quote text, you might want to select a custom typeface from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), or [AdobeTypekit](https://typekit.com/).

Your code looks great - and I think you're ready to begin development. You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!

**We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html**. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Add `/vendor` to your .gitignore

### PWP Final Feedback
Very nice work on a simple and attractive personal website. Based on what you were able to achieve here, I think you're ready for more challenging front-end work - so keep practicing and challenging yourself! Nice job.

*Code Base*: There are some minor issues with the `<a>` tags in your footer - they are "double nested". This shouldn't be necessary and it  isn't proper. If you did this for styling purposes use a `<span>` to wrap the links instead. See lines 288-304. Otherwise what you have here looks good! I also advise organizing your images and css in subdirectories of their own - this is how it should be done.

*Git Commits*: Awesome job utilizing version control! You've got great Git habits.

*Mobile-First Responsiveness*:  I've tested your page using devtools, Chrome on Linux, and Chrome & Firefox on Android. Your design and layout looks great on all the platforms I tested, nice work. Nice work on the responsive form layout across breakpoints as well. The footer links are actually not working on Chrome on Android, and I think this has to do with the "double nested" links. They do work fine in Firefox on Android however.

*Design, Content, &amp; Overall Presentation*: Nice work on an elegant and professional design. Your content is thoughtful and well presented. Your background image is a bit too large for the web at 2.2MB. I suggest reducing the file size here to prevent laggy loading on mobile. If you don't have image editing software on your laptop - give https://pixlr.com/ a try.

*Contact Form*: Appears to work fine on my end - check and see if you got my test message.

Your PWP passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Your cumulative PWP score including all Milestones is 33/40 points (82.5%).

#### Suggestions
- Update your title text perhaps?
- We didn't discuss favicons, but you might want to consider adding one. Have a look at this tool which helps render multiple versions for cross-platform  support: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
